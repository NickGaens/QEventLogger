How to use in your Qt application
---------------------------------

1) Add the QEventLogger.h and QEventLogger.cpp files to your project, and add
   them to your .pro file.
2) Subclass QApplication, e.g. in the MyApplication class.
3) Include QEventLogger.h in MyApplication.h and add a QEventLogger member:
     QEventLogger * eventLogger;
4) In the MyApplication constructor, initialize the event logger and install
   it as an event filter (the first parameter is the basename of the
   resulting log files):
     this->eventLogger = new QEventLogger("./events");
     this->installEventFilter(this->eventLogger);
5) When you now build your application, you will get .csv files in the same
   directory as the application binary, with filenames such as
     "events 2010-10-29T20-29-17.csv"
